The +12V pins on the card slots is limited in capability, supporting approximately 2.5 amps on the Zorro slots and 1 amp on the ISA slots. If you intend to use multiple high current draw devices, such as mechanical hard drives, it is recommended you power them directly from the power supply. The +5V pins are not so limited and will support approximately 2.5 amps per slot. The -5V and -12V pins will support approximately 1 amp total between all slots.
