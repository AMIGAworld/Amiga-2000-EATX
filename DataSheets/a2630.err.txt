              A2630 Fault Analysis, by Perry Weinthal, PA CBM-WC

    The A2500/30 is currently having DMA problems with the A2630 and A2091.
  The symptoms are only apparent while performing a DMA transfer while
  using 32 bit RAM on the A2630.  A DMA transfer to either chip RAM or
  to 16 bit expansion RAM will be performed properly.  

------------ Late Breaking News!  ----------------------------------------
    Well, guess what, all the junk below can be reduced to the following.
  When the jumper was placed on the A2630 (J302) to allow for operation 
  WITHOUT the 68000, the system worked!  This leads me to suspect bus loading 
  or the equations of PAL U304 and the others dependent on it.  However,
  I can not point out what is the actual problem.  I have provided the 
  following as a guide, I would like to help in the actual debugging of this 
  problem.  Dave or George please call me when you are ready to work on it.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The DMA problem is cited by only one of the byte of the word transferred 
  being incorrect, and with bits being dropped -- a $FF becomes $5E, but a 
  $00 will not become a $03.  This was apparent only when a $F was part 
  of the test data, ie. $AAFF became $AAF0, $F05A became $005A.  

    Connecting a logic analyzer up to the 68000 socket caused the
  problem to disappear leading me to suspect bus loading on the CPU side.  
  However, after closer investigation this abnormality disappeared without 
  any reasonable explanation.  The next test was to take a working DMAC
  and try it in a non-functional A2091, this also yielded negative results.
  Other items tested, Gary and buster from the same working machine.  
 
    The revision to 6.2 for the A2000 switched the tri-stated bus from a 
  pull-high to a pull-low bus.  This was done by moving the resistor paks 
  RP900 and RP901 to the leads of the U603 and U604 on pins 1-10. The common 
  of the resistor paks are connected to ground, The CPU data lines and 
  _DIR line of both U603 and U604 are loaded by the RP.  The value currently 
  being used is 3.3K -- which is correct.  When I moved the common of the
  resistor pak from ground to +5V, the screen would blink shades of gray
  when the 68030 tried to run, but the system would work just fine on the 
  68000 when the CPU selected was the 68000 from the CPU select menu.
  I was informed that the bus condition should make no difference to the 
  A2630 ROMs, during a brief discussion with Johann George.  If this is the 
  case, then I can only infer that the results of the system being unable 
  to boot-up would be caused by bus loading problems.

    Sample info:
       A2630 test code results  ~30 units.
       A2630 hardware testing     3 units.
       A2630 w/o 68000            1 unit.  - with ~40 passes before leaving

   Have a good Day.

     Well, did that get your attention?   I should of gone home
  and got the bad news tommorow.  Well, here is the bad news.

    With the CPU bus set-up as tri-stated LOW, the DMA test failed 38 out
  of ~180 cycles.  Atleast, we have a clue!  I have set-up the CPU bus
  for tri-stated HIGH, and will see the positive results in the morning!

  Well, have a good nite.

   Hello Gang,

      This system survived the night with over 3600 DMA passes and
  not even a single FAILURE!   What did I do to get the wonderful 
  results?   Pulled the 68000 out set the jumper J302 and placed
  3.3K pull-ups on the CPU side of U603 and U604, without connecting
  to the _DIR line on pin 1.  

      Dave, I would like to help resolve the problem even further.
  I have three sets of PCB (A2000, A2091, A2630) that exhibit the 
  problem, only one has been modified.
