## PCB - Description and Ordering

The Amiga 2000 EATX PCB is 4 layers. See Table P1 for layer descriptions. Most components are on the top layer with the ATX on/off circuit and some Agnus and real time clock passives on the bottom.

Download the [Gerber zip file](/Gerber) and send to your favorite PCB manufacturer. If you do not have access to the appropriate stencil, it is highly recommended you purchase one at the time you purchase the PCB.

The development PCB's were purchased from JLCPCB and no issues were encountered. The JLCPCB order screens are shown to reflect their order options. Other PCB fabricators will have similar options, most will be set from the information in the gerber files. Other recommended order options are included to help guide you through the ordering process.

Final PCB thickness is 1.6mm.
